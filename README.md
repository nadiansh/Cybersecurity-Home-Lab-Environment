## Cybersecurity Home Lab Environment

ðŸ“Œ **Objective**
- Build and configure a personal cybersecurity home lab that mimics a real-world environment for hands-on practice in both offensive and defensive security. The lab runs multiple virtual machines simulating different roles (attacker, victim, firewall) and enables experimentation with network monitoring, intrusion detection, pentesting, and secure network design


ðŸ’¡ **Skills Learned:**
- Virtualization and VM management (VirtualBox)
- Network segmentation and topology design
- Firewall setup and management (pfSense)
- Offensive security practices (Kali Linux tools: Nmap, Hydra, Wireshark)
- Vulnerability assessment using Metasploitable 2
- Intrusion Detection/Prevention setup (Snort on pfSense)
- Secure remote access and user management


ðŸ”§ **Tools Used:**
- VirtualBox (VM hypervisor)
- pfSense (Firewall, router, IDS/IPS)
- Kali Linux (Penetration testing distro)
- Metasploitable 2 (Deliberately vulnerable VM)
- Snort (IDS/IPS plugin for pfSense)
- Networking utilities: Nmap, Wireshark, Hydra
